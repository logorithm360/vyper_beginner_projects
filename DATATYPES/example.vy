# üîç What is @view?

# In Vyper (and also in Solidity), @view is a function decorator used to mark a function that only reads the state of the smart contract but does not modify it.
# ‚úÖ When to Use @view

# You use @view when:

#     The function reads from the blockchain, like reading a variable (self.my_favorite_number in your case).

#     It does NOT write, update, or change any storage data.

#     It doesn't emit events, create new contracts, or send Ether.

# ‚ú® Why is it Important?

#     No gas required (if called externally): Calling a @view function doesn't cost gas because it doesn't change the blockchain. You can call it for free using a frontend (like Web3 or Ethers.js).

#     Better optimization & security: Vyper (and Ethereum in general) can optimize and protect functions more if it's clear they won't modify anything.
